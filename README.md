<h1>CalcuGrader</h1>
 
<h2>About</h2>

CalcuGrader is a web application that can calculate your grade average with different percentage weights. It can also provide the equation used to calculate said grade average as well as determine an additional score needed to achieve a specified grade average. This is a personal project I've been wanting to create since high school but never did because I didn't know where to start. Now that I'm learning web development, I figured why not put my new skills to use and make it now!
